# World Happiness Report
The World Happiness Report is a survey across different countries on the state of global happiness.
Each Country is given a ladder score, a value given based on the national average response on state of well-being or happiness.
This score was evaluated by taking several relevant factors into consideration.

### Relevant factors:
Logged GDP per capita           
Social support                  
Healthy life expectancy         
Freedom to make life choices    
Generosity                      
Perceptions of corruption

## Jupyter Notebook
Using Python we normalized and cleaned the data, as well as exploring data statistics. Matplotib and Seaborn were used to demonstrate the correlation between overall happiness score and relevant factors.
